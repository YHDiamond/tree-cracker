# Tree Cracker[^1]

This is a fork of [Andrew (Gaider10)'s TreeCracker](https://github.com/Gaider10/TreeCracker) that is intended to be streamlined and easier to use. Instead of having to juggle multiple distinct programs and libraries, one now only needs to input their data and settings into [a single file](./Settings%20(MODIFY%20THIS).cuh), then compile and run this program all at once. This fork also adds several extra features to the program, such as prioritizing high-information chunks and determining in advance whether one's input data is likely to be sufficient.

## Purpose
Given details about a set of Minecraft trees (such as their coordinates, types, and attributes), this code is designed to return a list of <!-- worldseeds --> structure seeds[^2] that could <ins>potentially</ins> generate those exact trees.

## Prerequisites and Limitations
At the time of writing, this program only officially supports
- Java Edition.
- Versions <!-- 1.6.4, 1.8.9, 1.12.2, --> 1.14.4, 1.16.1, 1.16.4, or 1.17.1. (Informally, if a specific version isn't supported, setting the relevant data to the next chronological supported version&mdash;e.g. marking 1.16.2 as 1.16.4&mdash;will sometimes still yield results.)
- Oak (normal or fancy) <!--, Spruce, Pine, --> or Birch trees.
- Forest <!--, Birch Forest, or Taiga --> biomes.

The program also uses CUDA, which requires one's device to have an NVIDIA CUDA-capable GPU installed. NVIDIA's CUDA also [does not support MacOS versions OS X 10.14 or beyond](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-cuda-toolkit-developer-tools-mac-hosts). If either of those requirements disqualify your computer, you can instead run the program on a virtual GPU for free (at the time of writing this, and subject to certain runtime limits) through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

If using Windows, you will also need some form of C++ compiler installed; however, there are a myriad of environments that provide one ([Microsoft Visual C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/compiler-options), though that in turn requires [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com); [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl); [Minimialist GNU for Windows-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org); and others).

## Installation, Setup, and Usage
1. Download the repository, either as a ZIP file from GitHub or by cloning it through Git.
2. Open [the Settings file](./Settings%20(MODIFY%20THIS).cuh) in your favorite code editor, and replace the examples of input data with your own, and the settings with your own. (For enumerations like `Version` or `Biome`, the list of supported values can be found in [Allowed Values for Settings.cuh](./Allowed%20Values%20for%20Settings.cuh).)

<!-- TODO: Rework warnings to apply these (i.e. warn about low first-tree and first-treechunk bits instead of total bits) -->
When creating your input data, keep in mind that <ins>the comprehensiveness of the data</ins> (specifically the number of "bits" of information the highest-information tree and treechunk <!-- TODO: Explain treechunks? --> reveal) <ins>matters far more than factors like the number of trees.</ins> For example, I and Chaos4669 once tried to crack the same worldseed using this tool:
 - my input data had eleven trees holding 123.87 combined bits of information, but my highest-information treechunk among that revealed only 54.71 bits and my highest-information tree only 13.06 bits&mdash;which caused the program to return dozens of possibilities and require multiple days before it could finish.
 - Chaos' input data ([`TEST_DATA_16_1_2`](./Test%20Data/1.16.1.cuh)), meanwhile, had half the number of trees and total bits of information, but his highest-information treechunk held 68.93 bits of information and his highest-information tree revealed 19.91 bits of information. With those, the program finished within five minutes and returned a mere four possibilities.

(The program will print the number of bits each piece of input data reveals when the program first begins running. If a multi-day runtime cannot be avoided, the program also comes with the ability to divide one's runs into "partial runs" so that one's run can be resumed midway-through at a later time.)

3. Go back and double-check your input data. There is an 80% chance you inputted something incorrectly the first time, and any mistakes will prevent the program from deriving the correct worldseeds.
4. Once you're *completely certain* your input data is correct&mdash;if you wish to run the program on Google Colab:
    1. Visit [the website](https://colab.research.google.com), sign in with a Google account, and create a new notebook.
    2. Open the Files sidebar to the left and upload the program's files, making sure to keep the files' structure the way it originally was (the underlying code files are inside a folder named src, etc.). Don't forget to upload the modified Settings file instead of the original.
    3. Under the Runtime tab, select "Change runtime type" and select T4 GPU as the hardware accelerator.
5. Whether on Google Colab or your own computer, open a terminal and verify [nvcc](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-compiler-driver-nvcc/index.html), the CUDA compiler, is installed:
```bash
(Linux/Windows/MacOS)  nvcc --version
(Google Colab)        !nvcc --version
```
If the output is an error and not the compiler's information, you will need to install the CUDA Toolkit which contains `nvcc`. (The following are installation guides for [Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux), [Windows](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows), and [MacOS X 10.13 or earlier](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/10.1/cuda-installation-guide-mac-os-x/).)

6. Navigate in the terminal to the folder where the program's files are contained:
```bash
(Linux/Windows/MacOS)  cd "[Path to the folder]"
(Google Colab)        !cd "[Path to the folder]"
```
Then use `nvcc` to compile the program:
```bash
(Linux)         nvcc main.cu -o "main" -O3
(Windows)       nvcc main.cu -o "main.exe" -O3
(MacOS)         nvcc main.cu -o "main.app" -O3
(Google Colab) !nvcc main.cu -o "main" -O3
```
Depending on your input data, the compilation may take almost a full minute or even longer.<br />
The compiler may print warnings akin to `Stack size for entry function '_Z11biomeFilterv' cannot be statically determined`: this is normal. (All this means is that the compiler couldn't determine the exact number of iterations certain recursive functions will undergo.)

7. Run the compiled program:
```bash
(Linux)         .\main
(Windows)       .\main.exe
(MacOS)         open -a main.app
(Google Colab) !.\main
```
As mentioned in step 2, the program's runtime can vary wildly based on one's input data and its comprehensiveness. Nevertheless, if all goes well, a file should ultimately be created (or a list should be printed to the screen, depending on your settings) containing your possible <!-- worldseeds --> structure seeds.

8. At some point, this program will also automatically filter structure seeds into potential worldseeds. This hasn't been implemented yet, though, so in the meantime one must perform this filtering manually.
    1. Download and open [Cubiomes Viewer](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes-viewer/releases).
    2. Under the Edit tab in the upper top-left, click "Advanced World Settings" and make sure "Enable experimentally supported versions" is enabled.
    3. Close the World Settings menu and set the "MC" input box in the top-left corner to your world's version (or the supported version closest to it).
    4. Under the Seed Generator heading, Click "Seed list", then use the button across from the "Load 48-bit seed list" option to select whichever file contains this program's outputted structure seeds.
    5. For each population chunk in your input data (these will have been displayed when <ins>this</ins> program first began running):
        - Under the Conditions heading, click "Add".
        - Select "Biomes" for the condition's category and "Overworld at scale" as the condition's type.
        - Select Custom for the location and enter the population chunk's coordinate range.
        - Select "1:1 ..." for the Scale/Generation Layer, then exclude all biomes except the population chunk's biome.
    6. When finished adding all conditions, click "Start search" at the bottom of the window. The program will then start outputting worldseeds that have biomes matching your input data.

WARNING: When checking the outputted worldseeds, some generated trees may not match your input data. (Tree generation depends on the order that chunks are loaded, so if the chunks are loaded in a different order than your input data's source, a different pattern of trees will form.) However, in most cases at least a few trees will match your input data; if *every* tree is different, that is an indication your original input data (or this tool) are likely wrong.

## Java 1.16.1 CUDA benchmark (October 2026)

This fork optimizes the existing Java-LCG and valid/invalid tree-attempt search. Production inference still searches the entire 2^44-state absolute-coordinate domain. The tree RNG model and acceptance predicates are unchanged. The integrated changes enumerate exact primary Z intervals, share coordinate work in the neighboring-state scans, and share/prune valid/invalid attempt prefixes in the treechunk filter.

Two existing correctness issues were repaired before performance comparisons: host access to device-only result buffers could discard candidates, and 32-bit treechunk indexing could omit states in large launches. Comparisons use these repairs consistently and reject every overflowing run. The old Linux port returned one candidate on `TEST_DATA_16_1_2`; corrected host access returns the documented four candidates, including `157527116063087`.

All measurements used the same allocated Tesla T4: UUID `GPU-2891ecda-a53e-c564-6771-d543407075ff`, driver 580.82.07, CUDA 13.0.88. Compilation is excluded from solve times. Complete measurements, pinned source commits, flags, input hashes, test windows and candidate sets are in [the five-seed report](tests/results/five-seed-t4.json), [the combination report](tests/results/combined-scan-t4.json), and [the exhaustive reference report](tests/results/reference-t4.json).

The five fixtures contain two public examples and three instrumented development-world Forest chunks. Each test input has absolute X/Z and tree type; heights and leaf corners are unknown. Development chunk biomes were verified from their development saves. No blind records were opened. These tests validate the standalone cracker with supplied tree observations; they do not measure video extraction or blind evaluation.

The following are median **validation-only regression** pipeline times in seconds, three repeats per fixture, over identical windows of 2^21 states with capacity 2^22. Known seeds locate positive windows only in the test executable, so every run must retain a real expected seed. Production inference never reads those validation seeds. These timings include stage-by-stage test checks and must not be interpreted as exhaustive seed recovery times.

| Variant | Public 4 trees | Public 5 trees | Dev 9 trees | Dev 8 trees | Dev 10 trees |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Corrected baseline | 10.908249 | 1.158632 | 0.083872 | 0.410807 | 0.059132 |
| Shared scan | 10.910895 | 1.159273 | 0.063400 | 0.418232 | 0.049571 |
| Primary intervals | 10.908272 | 1.159967 | 0.079580 | 0.412385 | 0.057368 |
| 128-thread blocks / sort | 10.909658 | 1.162082 | 0.080481 | 0.415300 | 0.055784 |
| Primary + prefix search | 0.217338 | 0.068668 | 0.053583 | 0.067597 | 0.048405 |
| Primary + prefix search + scan | 0.217542 | 0.065370 | 0.043956 | 0.054954 | 0.057434 |

All 90 GPU regression runs passed with identical sorted candidate sets and all five expected seeds retained. The per-fixture candidate counts were 27, 4, 1, 2 and 3. Sixteen CPU tests cover interval arithmetic, Java-LCG scan parity, 64-bit dispatch and prefix-search equivalence.

The complete, documented `TEST_DATA_16_1_2` example retains its trunk-height and leaf-corner observations. On the same T4, corrected baseline took **232.033 s**, primary intervals **105.001 s**, primary plus prefix search **72.310 s**, and adding the shared scan **65.881 s median** over three full runs (65.874–70.990 s), a **3.52×** speedup over the corrected baseline. Every exhaustive run returned exactly `[89593286004526, 115468527086863, 157527116063087, 272740909957168]`. These are 48-bit structure seeds; no unique 64-bit world seed is claimed.

An initial four-tree positions/types-only diagnostic took 87.235 s for its first 2^24 primary states before the 32-bit treechunk indexing defect was found. Its candidate set was incomplete and is excluded from correctness comparisons. An exhaustive run would take years if that diagnostic rate persisted. Five exhaustive positions/types-only recoveries were not performed; the five positive regression tests and the rich full-domain example are reported separately.

Reproduce the fixed five-seed comparisons from this branch on one CUDA GPU:

```bash
python3 tests/benchmark.py --positive-window --workers 2097152 --capacity 4194304 --repeats 3 \
  --variant baseline=87d3675 --variant scan=b231ecf --variant primary=cf41a29 \
  --variant host=2d338c1 --variant primary-dfs=9ddaf10 --output benchmark-results/five-seed
python3 tests/benchmark.py --positive-window --workers 2097152 --capacity 4194304 --repeats 3 \
  --variant combined-scan=de9371e --reference-report benchmark-results/five-seed/report.json \
  --output benchmark-results/combined-scan
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The output path must be new. Omit `--positive-window` for the exhaustive positions/types-only search, which requires far more GPU time. `--profile-batches` explicitly selects an incomplete first-window diagnostic. The reports label these modes and refuse comparisons after the GPU allocation or benchmark configuration changes.

For the documented full example, remove the placeholder `INPUT_DATA` array from the Settings file and define `INPUT_DATA` as `TEST_DATA_16_1_2`. Keep the existing default domain, batch size and sixteen partial runs. On the tested Linux/Colab CUDA 13 environment:

```bash
nvcc main.cu -o main -O3 -arch=sm_75 -Xcompiler=-mcmodel=large -Xlinker=--no-relax --cudart=shared
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-} ./main
```

[^1]: ...or more accurately "Tree Brute-forcer", but the previous term is so ingrained in seedcracking culture that I can't exactly change it now.
[^2]: If one converts a worldseed into a 64-bit binary integer, a structure seed corresponds to the worldseed's last 48 bits. Therefore each structure seed has 2<sup>16</sup> = 65536 worldseeds associated with it. ...eventually, biome filtering will be used to directly return worldseeds instead of structure seeds, but this has not been finished yet.
[^3]: While the license discusses this, I want to emphasize one aspect of it here: this repository relies upon numerous others' repositories (Gaider10's TreeCracker, Gaider10's Population Chunk Reverser, Cubitect's Cubiomes library, etc.), and thus my license solely applies to the changes I and any voluntary contributors made within this repository, not to their repositories or any code in this repository that is untouched from their repositories.
